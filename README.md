# IHHS-Virtual-Tour-React-360-

Welcome to the Immaculate Heart High School Virtual College Tour. This tour are for those of you that cannot make it to the in person tour for whatever reason. We want you to be immersed in the Immaculate Heart experience no matter where you are in the world. 

This project is meant to be incorporated in a collaboration with the rest of the class so it is has some html files. However, the project is mostly written in JavaScript. 

Note: the following project is subject to change and will undergo multiple updates in the near future. 

Enjoy!
